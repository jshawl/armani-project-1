# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice job on your user stories! In the future, it would be nice to see more evidence of your planning process,
like a Trello board with current, backlog, and icebox lists for your user stories.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job creating a game that works! There are a few opportunities to DRY up your code and simplify your implementation,
but more on that in the code quality section. I especially appreciate the effort you put into the visuals of your application, including the vendor-prefixed
gradients!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Does Not Meet Expectations**. Please indent code correctly and remove unused/unworking code before submitting in the future. This will increase the
readability of your code, and make it easier to debug in the future. Also, I recommend creating variables for commonly used jQuery selectors,
like `$(".q1")`. I am interested in working with you to refactor this code to be more DRY and reusable.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. Overall, nice job on project 1! In the future, I recommend starting small and getting one thing to work well. Then, avoid the
temptation to copy and paste a working solution and look for ways to modularize your code and share functionality.
